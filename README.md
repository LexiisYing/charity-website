The idea behind the Buddy group projects is to get you working in groups and collaborating together, in order to make a successful product at the end of the 8 weeks. The product should be a basic website without any backend, only frontend. We want you to showcase everything you have learnt so far but in a collaborative manner and working as a group. The website should be something that has a positive impact on society. Each person in the group should take on a specific role that they have researched and play that role during the 8 weeks in relation to your product i.e. since the product is front end only, you wonâ€™t need a back end developer.

Week 4 (3/12): During the PD session in week 4, you will get 20/25 mins to work in your groups to come to gather and work together. The task for this week is to prepare a professional document to pitch your idea to a stakeholder.

Week 5 (10/11): There will be no PD session next week, instead you will be presenting your MVP and everything you have researched over the past 4 weeks to the class. Each week you were asked to create some sort of slides or documents and you will now get a chance to present it all to your peers. Your presentation should have the following as a minimum

** Your understanding of different roles in tech
** What is agile - explain the 4 principles
** Tell us your idea for the project
** What did the decision making process look like in choosing  your final idea
** Any conflicts or issues that arrived and how you overcame them as a team.

From the 17th of December 2022 to the 21st of January 2023 (4 Saturday sessions include 2 week christmas break), you will work on this project during the PD sessions; you will spend the of the class time building your MVP with your team, and we will have some project related exercises.
